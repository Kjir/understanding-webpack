# Exercise 3: Reuse code

## Convert to CommmonJS

We have our little application that now shows us a users and an author with the
correct names. We want to prettify the name of the author and of the user by
using the function that we can find in `util.js`

1. Convert `util.js` to CommmonJS format.
2. Convert `user.js` and `author.js` in CommmonJS format as well.
3. Import the `prettify` function in both `user.js` and `author.js` and use it.
4. Check the result in browser

Did it work? If not, why not?
